<p>Clicking <em>Inrooster</em> will redirect the manager to a page where he can schedule people.
<img src="../images/Manage/inroosteren.png" alt="image"></p>
<p>On this page the manager wil get an overview of all the shifts that are planned on a given day.<br>
By default the first day that is selected is the current day.<br>
If the current day does not fall between the participationStartDate and the ParticipationEndDate, the participationStartDate will be used as first day.</p>
<h3 id="date-selection">Date selection</h3>
<p>The manager is able to change the active dat by using the <em>&lt;</em> and <em>&gt;</em> buttons next to the date OR by using the mini-calendar on the left side.<br>
In the manager is only able to select days in the mini-calendar that are within the participation-startdate and participation-enddate range AND are not in the past.</p>
<h3 id="mini-calendar">Mini-calendar</h3>
<p>The mini-calendar uses various colors to indicate the status of shifts on the given day.</p>
<ul>
<li>If the date is highlighted red it means there are not enough people available to plan <strong>all</strong> shifts that day.</li>
<li>If the date is highlighted green it means there <strong>are</strong> enough people available to plan all shifts that day.</li>
<li>If the date is highlighted blue it means that every shift on a given day has at least one person scheduled.*</li>
</ul>
<p>*Be careful: Blue does <strong>not</strong> indicate that <em>enough</em> people are scheduled on each shift that day.</p>
<h3 id="checkboxes">Checkboxes</h3>
<p>Below the mini-calendar are various checkboxes.<br>
Each checkbox represent a projecttask.<br>
Using these checkboxes, the manager is able to filter certain tasks from the overview container.<br>
Task that are deselected will not be shown in the overview container.</p>
<p>If a checkbox is grayed-out, it means that, that particular task does not have any shifts on the active day.<br>
The user is unable to select or deselect grayed-out checkboxes.</p>
<h3 id="legend">Legend</h3>
<p>Below the mini-calendar and the checkboxes is a legend providing information about the meaning of the various colors in the mini-calendar.</p>

<ol>
<li>The title of the shift task.</li>
<li>The amount af people who are: necessary, scheduled and available.</li>
<li>A button to plan the specific shift.</li>
</ol>

<ul>
<li>Shifts shorter then 4 hours will not display information piece #2.</li>
<li>Shifts shorter then 1 hour will not display information piece #1.</li>
<li>Depending on the amount of overlapping shifts, the overview-container will change the fontsize of the title.</li>
<li>Depending on the length of the shift and the number of overlapping shifts, the container will change the button size.</li>
</ul>
<p>Clicking a plan button will redirect the manager to a specific page where he can schedule people or remove people from the schedule.</p>
<h4 id="schedule-shift">Schedule shift</h4>
<p><img src="../images/Manage/inroosteren.png" alt="image">
On this page, the manager will get a summary of the shift and a table containing all employees available to work that shift.<br>
