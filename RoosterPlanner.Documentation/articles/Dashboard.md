# Dashboard

![image](../images/Dashboard.png)

The dashboard is the landing page for each user.  
On this page you will find a overview of all projects that you are currently participating in.
Only 'Active' participations are show.  
An inactive participation is when either the user has stopped participating in a project, the project is closed or the project has reached its enddate.

When there are no active participations present, the user will be shown a alternate dashboardscreen.

The user can use either the big button in the middle or the button in the title bar to sign up for a project.

Each time the user signsup for a project, he  wil be first prompted to confirm his profiledate.

After filling in the required fields the user will be prompted to select one or more projects he wants to participate in.

Each project is represented by a card.  
Each card offers four options.
