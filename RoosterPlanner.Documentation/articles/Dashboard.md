## Overview
![image](../images/Dashboard/Dashboard.png)


The dashboard is the landing page for each user.  
On this page you will find a overview of all projects that you are currently participating in.
Only *Active* participations are show.  
An inactive participation is when either the user has stopped participating in a project, the project is closed or the project has reached its enddate.

## Firsttime / No active participations
When there are no active participations present, the user will be shown a alternate dashboard page.

The user can use either the big button in the middle or the button in the title bar to sign up for a project.

## Register for a project
Each time the user signs-up for a project, he  wil be first prompted to confirm his profile date.

Each card offers four options.
